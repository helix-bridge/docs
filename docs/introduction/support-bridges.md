# Bridge Aggregation
## Celer cBridge
 Helix supported cBridge from version 4.0.2(released on Aug 2 2022)

 Celer cBridge is a decentralized and non-custodial asset bridge that supports 110+ tokens across 30+ blockchains and layer-2 rollups. It use State Guardian Network called SGN to verify bridge event. And it also supports generic across chains messages.
 We support cBridge aggregation for the following reasons
 * It has deep liquidity to support much larger transfer sizes.
 * It's easy to use, single click to transfer cross chain and only one more click to refund.
 * cBridge is built on top of Celer IM, which support a hybrid model to provide higher security according to different scenarios.
 * The costs are not very high.

Although we believe that cBridge is a quality security asset bridge due to the above analysis, Helix only provides access to the bridge and users should be aware of their own security risks when choosing a bridge.
