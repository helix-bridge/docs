# About Helix

## Introduction

Helix will provide a secure and convenient service for asset cross-chain users. On one hand, Helix integrates with the best asset bridge projects in the industry, providing users with a filtered list of asset bridges and a cross-chain portal. On the other hand, Helix will also use common bridge projects in the market to help users complete asset cross-chain.

We will gradually support various EVM-based chains, and we will also go deeper into the polka ecology to support asset exchange in various substrate chains.

Helix is careful about the security of users' assets and will do strict screening of the integrated asset bridge projects. For the user assets hosted in Helix will do multi-layer redundant security verification and use Dao to do emergency rescue for the worst scenario.

Helix will support various types of asset cross-chains such as Erc20, Erc721, etc.

Helix also provides transaction history display and analysis services, all cross-chain transfer records and details will be clearly displayed.
