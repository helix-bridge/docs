7. Then you will be prompted to **confirm the transaction in polkadot{.js}**（or in MetaMask if your currently connected wallet is MetaMask）. Click "Confirm". 
8. After confirming on polkadot{.js}, you have submitted the transaction. 
9. When the transfer is completed, the transaction status will turn to “Success”. You can check the transaction status and details in `“History”`.
