> Sometimes you may need to initiate a claim transaction of the target network to receive this token. Just check and claim in the `Transfer History`  (in the top right corner of the page). You need to prepare some ETH as the gas fee to claim this token.
>7. Then you will be prompted to **confirm the transaction in polkadot{.js}**（or in MetaMask if your currently connected wallet is MetaMask）. Click "Confirm". 
8. After confirming on polkadot{.js}, you have submitted the transaction. You can check the transaction status in **“History”** in the top right corner of the page, which shows all your transfer records of the currently connected account.
9. When the transfer is completed, the transaction status will turn to “Success”. You can view the specific transaction information by clicking the *arrow button* and navigating to the “Transaction Detail“ page**.**
