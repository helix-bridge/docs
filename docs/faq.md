1. **How long does it take to complete a cross chain transfer?**

    Most of the cross-chain transfers take 5-60 minutes to complete via Helix Bridge (Self-developed) and 5-20 minutes via cBridge (Third-Party Token Bridge).

    1. If your transfer via Helix Bridge is stuck in the pending status for more than 1 hour, feel free to contact [us](mailto:hello@helixbridge.app).
    2. If your transfer via cBridge is stuck in the pending status for more than 30 minutes, please check on [this page](https://cbridge-docs.celer.network/reference/faq#my-cross-chain-transfer-has-been-stuck-for-more-than-30-minutes.-what-should-i-do).---
